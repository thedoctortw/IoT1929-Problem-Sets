# IoT1929-Problem-Sets

In this repo I will be adding the projects and homeworks that I am seeing in the DSC GAZI IoT1929 Bootcamp.

Projects added so far:

1-Haberlesme(Communication): A simple IoT application. The user enters a password on the python application and the information gets checked based on the designated password in
the arduino and sends the information of whether the user can enter or not, back to  the python application. the two devices connected via usb cable in this example.
